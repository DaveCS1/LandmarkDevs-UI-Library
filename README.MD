# LandmarkDevs UI Library
> UI Controls and Styles for WPF Applications

## Summary
This library is used for custom controls and styles in WPF applications. Some of the classes in this library were taken from the [MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit). These classes credit that project in the class comments. The dialogs implementation was taken from the [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) project. The dialogs were changed a little bit to make it easier to implement in my applications. The credit for these classes and controls belongs to each project and not myself. There are also other classes in this library that I found when starting programming a few years ago. I didn't realize the importance then of putting the credits in those classes so if you see something and know it came from somewhere else please let me know and I'll be more than happy to add the credits to those classes. Some of the controls are not fully implemented so use at your own risk. This is more of a personal project that I have made over the years and decided to make public.
